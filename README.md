# CryptoForecaster
Current working rendition of CryptoForecaster. My favorite program to date


This builds on a previous rendition of the same project wherein the past I tried to use a forecasted price through regression models.

My motivation for this project was to turn a problem that people often view as purely regression based into a classification problem
and instead of focus on price, create a model that would buy or sell given some technical environment.

The project makes use of a broad set of technologies and in the future will continuously be improved upon and put into a real stakes 
situation
